# Background-Change-Color
This is a ***HTML , CSS , JAVASCRIPT*** code which changes the ```background color randomly by just clicking on the provided button.```

Just clone the repo after fork from this repo to your account.

***The command for clone is :-***

```git clone 'url of this repo'.```

You can copy the url of this repo from the code section button.

After cloning you get all the files on your local machine such as on VS Code if you are using that or any others.

Just save and open with live server or the shortcut **ALT+L ALT+O** and you get the magic by clicking the button provided at center, the background color gets changed by clicking on the button randomly.

**Thanks!!**
